/*
 * Demonstration of the autonomous motion switch function
 *
 * autonomousMotionSwitch() is an implementation of a use case described in the
 * datasheet for the ADXL362 sensor. It can be used to trigger an alarm or turn
 * equipment on when motion is detected, and turn it back off when the motion
 * goes away. In this example an LED is turned on or off.
 *
 * The sensor is configured to pull its INT1 pin high as soon as motion is
 * detected, and pull it low when a period of inactivity is detected. The demo
 * sketch goes into low lower sleep, waiting for a change to happen, and turns
 * the LED on or off respectively. If an error is detected, the LED blinks at a
 * faster rate.
